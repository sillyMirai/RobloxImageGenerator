This project aims to bring generative AI capabilities to Roblox. It connects the Roblox client to an ASP.NET server app that handles the generation and storage of images and metadata.

The Roblox [EditableImage](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/EditableImage)  beta feature is utilized for rendering images from pixel data returned by the server.

[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit), and [Diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) are used for image generation.
